## Planning

My plan when approaching this project was to get the backend done first. It was the thing that I was the least experienced with so I wanted to give it my freshest mind. After creating the table structure and routes on the backend the plan was to create the RESTful routes on the front end and start serving the responses with basic HTML and CSS and build from there.

## Development Process

Doing the backend first was the best plan I could have came up with. I took my time and made sure the table structure was correct before proceeding. This allowed me to spend most of my time, effort, and brain power on the front-end without worrying if I had the correct structure on the server side. The front-end proved to be very time consuming because of all the features I wanted to implement. I didn't really understand how involved that would be and ultimately lead me down a somewhat overwhelming road where I was trying to connect all of the features seamlessly.

## Unsolved Problems

* Getting episodes to play audio.
